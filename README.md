# Create backing tracks for your open mic or karaoke night

I perform in open mics in my spare time, when I decide to perform a cover of a song
I usually play the guitar as well as singing it.
Therefore, I create a backing track for the song that doesnâ€™t have either the voice or the guitar,
that way, I can play it on the background while I sing and play the guitar.

about how to create a backing track.

Please also read `split-track.sh` for an automated script that runs the
two commands run in the article above.
